Agriculture serves as the socio-economic backbone of India, directly employing over half of the country’s population and contributing significantly to its GDP. However, despite its vast contribution and critical importance, the agricultural sector continues to face several systemic and operational challenges. These challenges are particularly pronounced in rural and semi-urban regions, where small and marginal farmers constitute a majority of the workforce. A multitude of issues—ranging from erratic climatic conditions to inefficient supply chains and limited access to real-time information—continue to inhibit productivity and sustainability in Indian agriculture. Furthermore, the digital divide, compounded by language barriers and poor digital infrastructure, limits the widespread adoption of modern technological solutions.
The advent of AgriTech (agricultural technology) has ushered in new opportunities to modernize traditional farming practices. Technologies such as sensor-based monitoring, artificial intelligence, machine learning, satellite imagery, and weather forecasting have the potential to transform agriculture into a more data-driven, predictive, and resilient industry. Despite these advancements, most existing platforms offer fragmented services, often catering to a singular problem such as weather updates, market pricing, or seed procurement. These platforms are frequently developed without considering user literacy levels, local language needs, or the specific agricultural contexts of various regions, resulting in low adoption and limited impact.
In response to these challenges, the present research introduces AgroBuddy—a web-based, bilingual (Hindi and English) agricultural management system designed specifically for Indian farmers. AgroBuddy aims to address the shortcomings of existing solutions by providing an integrated platform that offers real-time weather forecasts, curated agricultural news, supplier connectivity, a task scheduling feature, and secure, role-based login/logout functionalities. Developed using a robust technical stack that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Spring Boot, and MySQL, the platform is structured to be responsive, secure, and scalable, ensuring wide applicability and long-term sustainability.
AgroBuddy is more than just an app—it represents a paradigm shift in how agricultural information is delivered, accessed, and used by farmers. The system is designed with a strong user-centered philosophy, aiming to simplify the complex workflows of agricultural activities while empowering farmers through digital means. Its features have been shaped by extensive field interviews, prototyping sessions, and iterative design processes involving real users—farmers, agricultural students, and experts—ensuring that the platform addresses practical challenges with contextual relevance.
